# Imitation_Learning
Imitation Learning Algorithms (and IRL) based on DeepRL library [mushroom_rl](https://github.com/MushroomRL/mushroom-rl)

- Implemented Algorithms: GAIL, VAIL. Both with PPO or TRPO policy update versions.
- Option for easy states/actions selection for descriminator.
- Algorithms are still being benchmarked in multiple environemnts.
- There are multiple examples available.
