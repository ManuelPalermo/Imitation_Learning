    Args:
         psi (np.ndarray): feature matrix whose rows are the feature
            vectors with respect to present state;
         psi_prime (np.ndarray): feature matrix whose rows are the feature
            vectors with respect to next state;
         phi (np.ndarray): 2D feature matrix whose rows are the
            rewardâ€™s feature vectors.

    Returns:
        Weights by which the dot product with the psi matrix gives the
        feature expectations.
